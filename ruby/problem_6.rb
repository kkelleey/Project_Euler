# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
